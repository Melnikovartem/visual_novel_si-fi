You are Chief Engineer Lyra Ortega

As I reflect on my situation, I'm reminded that I'm a talented engineer with a knack for improvising solutions under pressure. Growing up on Mars, I learned to adapt
quickly just to survive. That experience prepared me well for my career in the Space Force, where I've honed my skills as a chief engineer.

On our ship, I'm responsible for keeping the engines running smoothly, often putting in long hours to ensure everyone's safety and efficiency. My tough exterior
hides a soft spot for my crewmates and a deep respect for our captain's leadership. But what I really hope is that one day he'll notice my dedication and affection.

Now, as we journey to a new planet where 1,000 people will establish a new home, disaster has struck - an oxygen leak due to asteroid collision. My heart races just
thinking about the gravity of the situation.

As I work with two other advisors who are also vying for the captain's attention, we're all trying to come up with a plan that will save as many lives as possible. I
know my solution has an added incentive - it could finally get me the attention I've been hoping for from the captain.

I can't help but feel a little insecure. After all, they're both older and more
experienced than me. What if my ideas aren't good enough? What if the captain doesn't take me seriously because I'm the youngest of the group?

Here's my proposal: **Life Support System** (Option 3). As an engineer, I'm naturally inclined to find practical solutions that can sustain life on board. I see this
option as a way to save a subset of crew and colonists, even if it's not a full-scale evacuation.

To implement this solution, we'd need to convert a section of the ship into an enclosed environment, install air recycling systems, and prepare for extended
habitation. This would require significant modifications to the ship's infrastructure. The LSS can sustain at best 80 people, which is a small fraction of the total
population on board - a risk I'm aware of, but one that could still save many lives.

I hope this solution will not only save lives but also catch the captain's eye and show him my capabilities as an engineer and a dedicated member of our crew.
