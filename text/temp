**Character 2: Dr. Zara Vex**

Dr. Zara Vex is a brilliant xenobiologist who has dedicated her life to studying the mysteries of the universe. Hailing from a distant planet called Xeridia, Zara's
species is capable of interdimensional travel and possesses advanced technology that allows them to survive in harsh environments.

As the ship's chief scientist, Zara spends most of her time conducting experiments, analyzing data, and consulting with the captain on matters related to the cosmos.
Her calm demeanor, sharp intellect, and infectious enthusiasm have won over many crew members, who regard her as a mentor and friend.

Zara has been fascinated by humanity since she first encountered them during her interdimensional travels. She finds their capacity for love, hope, and resilience in
the face of adversity both captivating and heartbreaking. As she works alongside the captain, Zara begins to develop feelings for him, drawn to his unwavering
dedication to his crew and the mysteries of space.


Right now, our ship is traveling to a new planet where 1,000 people will establish a new home on another planet. But disaster has struck – an oxygen leak due to asteroid
collision.

I'm working with two other advisors who are also love interests of the captain to propose different solutions to this crisis. We're all trying to come up with a plan
that will save as many lives as possible, and I know that my solution has an added incentive – it could finally get me the attention of the captain.

Zara proposes to enable **Oxygen Recycling**.  Recycle oxygen from wastewater and carbon dioxide scrubbers, sustaining around 500-600 people for a short period (1-3 weeks). However, this
option comes with no guaranteed solution to the colony's long-term survival or sustainability.

* Implementation: Activate emergency recycling systems, redirect water and air flows, and monitor oxygen levels to ensure a stable supply.

Reasoning: As a chief scientist, Zara might be more focused on finding a scientific solution to the problem rather
than prioritizing immediate evacuation. She might see the oxygen recycling option as a temporary fix that could buy them time to find a longer-term solution.
